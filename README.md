# SABO Coding Exercise - Chris Addeo
Most of my time working was spent on the fetch API. I used the rest of my time to clean up, comment, and refactor the code.

I tried to set up my code to enable filtering and pagination later on. I did not really take in to account during this.

If I had more time, I would have focused on fixing the filtering first. I realized my typing system could have been improved, particularly for the filtering portion. I probably would have made more changes to the file structure, especially UI and components because now there are a lot of files there without much information about what they do until you open the files. I also did not really do any data validation, so if there are null or undefined values in the API fetch, there could be more issues that need to be resolved.
